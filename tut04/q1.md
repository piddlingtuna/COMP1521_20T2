## Question 1

The MIPS processor has 32 general purpose 32-bit registers, referenced as $0 .. $31. Some of these registers are intended to be used in particular ways by programmers and by the system. For each of the registers below, give their symbolic name and describe their intended use: 


### Zero register
$0 == $zero

This never changes...


#### assembler temporary register
$1 == $at


#### Value registers
$2-$3 == $v0-$v1

Why do we need two return values?

int == v0 == 32 bits

double == 64 bits == v0 + v1


#### argument registers
$4-$7 == $a0-$a3

What if we have more than 4 arguments?


#### temporary registers
$8-$15 == $t0-$9

The caller's reponsibility

int i = 1;
int j = 2;
move $t0 to the stack
int return_value = add(i, j);


#### safe registers
$16-$25 == $s0-$s9

The caller's reponsibility

add - you first safe $s registers


#### kernel registers
$26-$27 == $k0-$k1

What if you divide by 0?


More on the below next week...

#### global pointer
$28 == $gp

int add() {
    int i;
}

#### stack pointer
$29 == $sp


#### frame pointer
$30 == $fp


#### return address
$31 == $ra

PC - 100
PC = PC + 4
PC - 104
PC = PC + 4
PC == 108

b prompt

$ra = 108
PC == 1008
PC = PC + 4
PC == 1012

PC = $ra

PC - 200
PC - 101

## Important points:

## Convention

The register uses (almost) all convention.

$0 == $zero is read-only.

$1 == $at is used by the assembler so it may change randomly.

$26-$27 == $k0-$k1 is used by the kernel so it may change randomly... except we are on an emulator!

$31 == $ra

However, compilers (think dcc, gcc) use this so programs can work together. Ignoring the conventions means your MIPS won't work with compiled C.


### j vs b

`b address` is the same as `beq $zero, $zero, address`

b 100

PC = PC + 100

j 100

PC = 100

b is relative.

j is absolute.

b is slightly faster.

j is slightly more robust.

### .text vs .data

`.text` means run this code.

`.data` means place this in memory.

By default, assembly starts in `.text`... which is why andrewt doesn't include it.

If you place your `.data` first, make sure you place `.text` somewhere after it.
